# Duck-Code

Duck Code (or the Tarleton Programming Language) was a research project to develop a new programming environment for introducing new students to the concepts of programming. The environment centers around a duck working in a box factory. The duck is controlled indirectly by the student through a simple scripting language. The duck can move in all four cardinal directions in the 2D environment, it can examine items directly in front of it, and it can pick up and put down those items. There are boxes that can be moved by the duck, and can be repainted to be a different color using a box painter; there are also conveyor belts that can move the boxes around, and removers that will remove any box that comes in contact with it. Students would be given an objective at the start of each level that they must write a script to solve.

This is a Netbeans project originally compiled using Jdk 14 on Netbeans 12.0, though there shouldn't be anything stopping you from using a different Jdk and IDE if you choose to build the project on your own machine.
